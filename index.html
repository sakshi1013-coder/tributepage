        <p>Anandi Gopal Joshi (1865–1887) was one of the first Indian women to become a doctor in Western medicine. <br>
          She holds a special place in history for being a trailblazer in women's education and healthcare in India.<br>
          I admire Anandi Gopal Joshi because she was a true pioneer who broke barriers and challenged societal norms at a time when women had very limited rights or opportunities.<br>
           She was the first Indian woman to become a doctor in Western medicine, achieving this remarkable feat in the 19th century — when women's education was not even encouraged, let alone a career in medicine.<br>
           She proved that women could achieve anything they set their minds to, if they had the courage, determination and support to do so. Anandi inspired many other Indian women to pursue higher education and careers in Medicine and other fields.</p>

        <h2>Why I Admire Them</h2>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>What inspires me the most is her courage and determination.
             Anandi was married at a very young age, and yet, with the support of her husband and her own unwavering spirit, she pursued her dream of studying medicine</li>
          <li>She went all the way to the United States for her education, which was a bold and unheard-of decision for an Indian woman at the time.
            Despite facing health issues, cultural challenges, and even criticism from society, she earned her medical degree at the age of 19. 
            Her story proves that with passion and perseverance, nothing is impossible.</li>
          <li>She inspires me to value education, to stand up for my goals, and to never be afraid of breaking stereotypes.</li>
        </ul>
